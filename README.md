# Mock-Webesite_Horiseon_Challenge-1

## Description

In this challenge I was able to use the HTML and CSS knowlege we had gone over in class to redfine code for the mock Horiseon website, while keeping it functional.  The steps I took to accomplish this were: accessing the index file in the Challenge/Develop folder, redefining "dev" with more semantic related elements that did not bug the website and furthered my understanding of HTML and CSS elemtns, as well as upload the files to a repo in Github.
